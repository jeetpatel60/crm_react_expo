# SAMVIDA CRM - APK Black/White Screen Fix

## Problem
After building the preview APK, the app shows a black/white screen instead of navigating to the dashboard.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is likely caused by:
1. Database initialization failures in production builds
2. Missing error handling during app startup
3. Silent failures that don't provide user feedback
4. Potential React Native new architecture compatibility issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in App.tsx
- ✅ Added comprehensive error catching and logging
- ✅ Implemented retry mechanism with user feedback
- ✅ Added detailed initialization step tracking
- ✅ Integrated debug logging throughout the process

### 2. Improved Database Initialization (src/utils/databaseUtils.ts)
- ✅ Added retry logic for database connection
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with user-friendly descriptions
- ✅ Added database integrity verification
- ✅ Implemented step-by-step initialization logging

### 3. Debug Utilities (src/utils/debugUtils.ts)
- ✅ Created persistent logging system
- ✅ Added performance monitoring
- ✅ Implemented debug information display
- ✅ Added system information collection

### 4. Fallback UI Components
- ✅ Created FallbackScreen component for better error display
- ✅ Added ErrorBoundary for React error catching
- ✅ Implemented user-friendly troubleshooting options

### 5. Configuration Fixes
- ✅ Disabled new architecture (newArchEnabled: false) for stability
- ✅ Maintained all existing plugins and permissions

## Files Modified

### Core App Files
- `App.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and debug integration
- `app.json` - Disabled new architecture for compatibility

### Database Layer
- `src/utils/databaseUtils.ts` - Improved initialization with retry logic

### New Debug Components
- `src/utils/debugUtils.ts` - Debug logging and monitoring utilities
- `src/components/FallbackScreen.tsx` - User-friendly error display
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - React error boundary

### Documentation
- `debug-apk.md` - Comprehensive debugging guide
- `test-build.sh` - Automated build testing script

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Build New APK
```bash
# Using EAS CLI
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Or use the test script
./test-build.sh  # On Linux/Mac
# On Windows, run the commands manually
```

### 2. Install and Test
```bash
# Install APK
adb install path/to/your.apk

# Monitor logs during startup
adb logcat | grep -i "samvida\|error\|database"
```

### 3. Debug Information Access
If the app shows an error screen:
- Tap "Show Debug Info" to see detailed logs
- Use "Retry" button to attempt reinitialization
- Check system information and recent logs

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Successful Startup
1. App shows loading screen with detailed progress
2. Database initializes with step-by-step logging
3. App navigates to dashboard successfully

### Error Scenarios
1. If database fails: Shows detailed error with retry options
2. If React errors occur: ErrorBoundary catches and displays fallback
3. All errors are logged for debugging

## Debugging Commands

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Clear logs and monitor startup
adb logcat -c
adb logcat | grep -E "(SAMVIDA|ReactNativeJS|ExpoSQLite)"

# Monitor for specific issues
adb logcat | grep -i "error\|exception\|crash"
adb logcat | grep -i "sqlite\|database"
```

### App Management
```bash
# Clear app data
adb shell pm clear com.crmapp.mobile

# Reinstall app
adb uninstall com.crmapp.mobile
adb install path/to/your.apk
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Visibility**: No more silent failures - all errors are logged and displayed
2. **Recovery**: Retry mechanisms allow recovery from temporary issues
3. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify root causes
4. **User Experience**: Fallback screens provide clear guidance
5. **Stability**: Disabled experimental features that might cause issues

## Next Steps

1. Build and test the new APK
2. Monitor logs during startup
3. If issues persist, use the debug information to identify specific problems
4. The enhanced logging will provide much better insight into what's failing

## Emergency Recovery

If the app still fails to start:
1. Use `adb shell pm clear com.crmapp.mobile` to reset app data
2. Check device compatibility (Android 6.0+, sufficient storage)
3. Try installing on a different device to isolate device-specific issues
4. Use the debug information from the fallback screen to identify the exact failure point

The enhanced error handling and debugging features should provide much better visibility into what's causing the black/white screen issue.
